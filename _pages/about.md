Hello there, I'm **Oscar Wu** :wave:, and I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Data Science. My passion lies in utilizing advanced Machine Learning and NLP techniques to address real-world issues, particularly in the field of fake news detection and intervention.

For more details, check out my recent [Project Website of Mininfomration Management and Mulit-lingual Fake News Detection](https://counterinfodemic.org), a collaboration bwteen [Deakin Univeristy](https://deakin.edu.au) with [Gadjah Mada University](https://ugm.ac.id/en/). The project supported by the [International Research Partnerships Program](https://www.studymelbourne.vic.gov.au/industry/programs/research-partnerships) and [Veski](https://www.veski.org.au/people/xiao-liu/).

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive research experience in the field of AI :robot: and machine learning. Notably, I completed a minor thesis on :memo: `SHAP and LIME interpretability for COVID-19 Fake News Detection` and served as a research fellow on a [Multilingual Fake News Detection and Intervention Project](https://counterinfodemic.org). I also worked as a casual research assistant on various topics, including multi-objective optimization problems and factorization machines, while completing my master's degree.


In addition to my research experience, I have participated in various data analysis and industry projects, such as a pedestrian count project and an open data project for the [Deakin University Industry Student Capstone (DISC) Program for the City of Melbourne](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/MOP). My skills encompass Python, machine learning algorithms, NLP, data mining, and data communication.


In my free time, I love to get outside and move my body :running_man:. I enjoy hiking :mountain:, running :runner:, and cycling :bicyclist:. When I'm not exercising, I like to cook :man_cook: and organize my living space :house:. I'm also a big fan of Anime, with *Demon Slayer* being one of my favorites :tv:.
