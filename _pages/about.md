:smile: Hello! I'm **Oscar Wu** :sparkles:, a Master of Data Science graduate with a solid foundation in applied mathematics. I'm also an incoming PhD student at Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia.

My passion lies in utilizing advanced machine learning and data mining techniques to address real-world issues, especially in the field of fake news detection and intervention. For more details, check out my recent project website, [Multi-lingual COVID-19 Fake News Detection and Intervention](https://counterinfodemic.org), in collaboration with [Gadjah Mada University](https://ugm.ac.id/en/), Indonesia, supported by the [International Research Partnerships Program](https://www.studymelbourne.vic.gov.au/industry/programs/research-partnerships) and [VESKI](https://www.veski.org.au/people/xiao-liu/).

During my academic journey, I have accumulated valuable research experience, including a minor thesis on the interpretability of SHAP value and LIME for COVID-19 fake news detection, and serving as a research fellow at Deakin University on a multilingual COVID-19 fake news detection and intervention project. Additionally, I have worked as a casual research assistant on *Multi-objective Optimization Problems* and *Factorisation Machines* for the faculty of SEBE, Deakin University.

In addition to my research, I have participated in various data analysis projects, such as a pedestrian count project and an open data project for the [Deakin University Industry Student Capstone (DISC) Program for the City of Melbourne](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/MOP). My skills encompass Python, machine learning algorithms, NLP, data mining, and data communication.
