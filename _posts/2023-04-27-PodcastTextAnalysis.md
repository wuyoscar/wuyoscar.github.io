## Introduction
Podcasts are a popular form of media, offering listeners the opportunity to learn, be entertained, and stay informed. However, analyzing a podcast can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially if you have a lot of episodes to review. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze a podcast. By applying these techniques, we can gain insights into the topics discussed, the emotions expressed, and the overall content of the podcast. We'll cover the entire process, from collecting the podcast data to visualizing the results. So, let's get started! 


## Collecting Podcast Data

[Stochastic Volatility](https://www.stovol.club/) is a cross-cultural podcast initiated by three female media professionals.

At Stochastic Volatility, we have selected three episodes with themes related to ``Feminism`` for analysis. These episodes cover a range of topics related to women, such as gender equality, feminism, and women's roles in society. By using NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze the text data of these episodes, we hope to gain deeper insights into the discussions and perspectives presented on these important topics.
