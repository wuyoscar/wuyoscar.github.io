title: Machine Leraning - Matrix Decomposition
description: This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to matrix decomposition, a fundamental concept in linear algebra. By leveraging various matrix decomposition methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD) or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), the project aims to extract meaningful patterns and latent features from complex datasets, enabling enhanced data analysis and dimensionality reduction for further analysis or visualization.
